**[Let's Program and create a Geneva Drive in Tinkercad!](https://champierre.github.io/geneva-drive-en/)**

A Geneva drive is a mechanism that can convert continuous rotational motion into intermittent rotational motion.

This slide presents a method to program and create a 3D model of a Geneva drive using Tinkercad codeblock.
